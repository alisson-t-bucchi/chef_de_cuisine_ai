# 🧑‍🍳 AI Chef de Cuisine! 🤖

This project uses Streamlit and Cohere AI to help you create unique recipes based on the available ingredients. Simply enter the ingredients and select the type of dish you want to prepare, and the system will generate a personalized recipe for you.

## 📋 Features

- Ingredient Input: Enter a list of available ingredients. 

- Dish Type Selection: Choose from options such as:
  - Entrée 
  - Main course 
  - Dessert 
  - Drink or Cocktail

- Measurement System: Convert recipe units to:
  - Imperial system 
  - Metric system

- Recipe Generation: Get a detailed recipe with instructions based on your ingredients and preferences.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Streamlit: For the interactive user interface. 

- Cohere AI: To generate recipes based on custom prompts.

- Regex (re): For text conversion and manipulation (fractions and measurement units).

- Python: Main programming language for the project.

## 📦 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit cohere
```

3. Set Up the API Key:

- Create a config.py file in the main directory.

- Add your Cohere API key in the following format:
```bash
  - API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
``` 

4. Run the Application:
- Start Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run <file.py>
```

5. Use the Interface: Open the link generated by Streamlit in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501) and explore the app!

## 💡 How It Works

1. Data Input:

- Enter the ingredients you have. 

- Choose the desired dish type and preferred measurement system.

2. Recipe Generation:

- The application uses the Cohere API to create recipes based on the provided data.

- If you choose the metric system, imperial measurements will be automatically converted.

3. Result Display:

- The generated recipe is displayed in a readable format, ready to use in your kitchen!

## 🛠️ Additional Features

Unit Conversion 
- Metric: Ingredients in imperial measurements like "cup," "tablespoon," or "teaspoon" are automatically converted to the metric system (grams or milliliters).

- Regex for Fractions: Fractions like 1/2 or 3/4 are converted to decimal numbers.

## 💠 Potential Improvements

- Add support for multiple languages.  

- Implement additional measurement systems (e.g., weight in pounds or ounces).  

- Improve error handling for invalid inputs.  

- Add images or video tutorials for recipes.
